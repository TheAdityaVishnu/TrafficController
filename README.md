Traffic Controller Simulation Using Fuzzy Logic

This report presents a study where we see the industrial application of Fuzzy Logic
in a traffic control system that has an emergency override feature.

City traffic monitoring and control has become a global issue due to the rising
number of vehicles on the road, therefore we need ways and means to tackle this
global problem. Fuzzy Logic technology enables practical rules to be applied in a
manner similar to human reasoning. For instance, if humans were regulating the
traffic situation then they would behave in the following way, if the traffic is high on
north-south lanes and less on west-east lanes, then keep the green light longer on
north-south lanes. The benefit of Fuzzy Controller is that it helps the machine to
measure and comprehend ambiguous terms and conditions such as "high," "less,"
and "longer".

In this study, we prioritize higher amount of time for green light where there are long
queues. This helps in resolving vehicular congestion quickly and makes sure that an
optimum amount of time is given to each lane to clear traffic depending on the
situation.
